        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I've received two "high CPU" notices from my host about the CPU usage of my search and comments CGI scripts.  Before the second, I tried to obfuscate the name of the comments CGI a little, and it didn't help.  Since I'm hosting my blog and MHS on the same server, something's gotta give.  I doubt the spammers are hitting that site.  So for the time being I've disabled comments and search on this blog until a figure a way around this.  I'm not sure whether checking out MT's dynamic publishing is worth the work versus considering a move to WordPress.  Email me if you have comments.</p>]]></content>

            <![CDATA[<p>We're having another boy!  He's due May 9th.  We had a nice 30-minute ultrasound visit with him yesterday.</p><p>I've been very busy at work for the last month plus bringing up a cluster of two large Opteron-based servers running <a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/data_center.html">VI3 Enterprise</a>.  It's my first experience with the high-availability features of the VMware ESX platform.  It's very nice!  I've implemented a clustered iSCSI target implementation using <a href="http://www.netapp.com/products/filer/fas3000_ds.html">NetApp FAS3020</a>'s to serve as the shared storage.  Now that everything's up and integrated, it's working quite well.  Pretty soon I'll be ready to start moving real workload to the cluster.  I would work on VMware solutions full-time if I could; that's how good that software is.</p><p>I made the playoffs in the BDFL for the first time this year, but I didn't get past the first round.  Now that I've had a taste of the postseason, I want more!</p><p>Thinking about doing something different with the blog in the new year.  We'll see!</p>]]>
